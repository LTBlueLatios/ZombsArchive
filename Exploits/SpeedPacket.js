/**
 * @fileoverview SpeedPacket Exploit
 * This exploit works because Zombs.io inherits the same entiy base code server side from its predecessor
 * "lazershark.io". The contents of the code breaks down into the following:
 *
 * Opcode: 8 (Opcode for skill point)
 * Attribute ID: 18 (Matches the attribute ID for speed)
 *
 * The packet by itself is a packet meant to redeem a skill point. When the packet is sent,
 * it will redeem the skill point for speed and thereby increase the speed of the player.
 * The increase is not much, around 14%?, but it's enough to be a massive buff for the pressure
 * bugging glitch.
