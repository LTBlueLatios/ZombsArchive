# ZombsArchive

Zombs.io is dead. It's time to archive it.

RIP. It had a good run. 2017-2024. If only Yang wasn't so focused on pumping cash grabs. The game had so much potential.

This is a WIP. More content will be included soon.

The "death" of Zombs.io was personally dictated by incredibly low player count and the desensitisation of world records.
