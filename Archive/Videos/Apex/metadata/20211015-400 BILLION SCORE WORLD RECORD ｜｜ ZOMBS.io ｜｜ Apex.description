This is a short story of how I achieved a world record of 400 billion score!

Credit to Sirr0m for designing the main base used in the run.

Some more logic in case anyone is interested:
The reason the base isn't fully upgraded is because it was tested and proven that zombies are worth more score the more they get hit by towers. Not killed â€” hit. When a zombie is hit, its score potential will rise and the potential will only be given if a player/pet kills it. The reason that the towers are downgraded is to squeeze more tower hits in. For example: if the base had 24/24 tier 8 bomb towers, the bomb towers would damage the zombies too much and end up killing them. With them instead at tier 1, they get to fire at the zombies without killing them because the damage dealt is effectively zero, thus increasing the potential score.
