Hello Guys! 
Noma did a great job afking for 11 days :). I am glad I was able to find him and help him as much as I could. I never really recorded a raider so I decided to wait for one while recording! It worked! I hope you enjoy the video, One should be out soon. I would like to thank Demo for making this thumbnail! Here is his channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC4Q28czyJPjSPtYQerbPGw
