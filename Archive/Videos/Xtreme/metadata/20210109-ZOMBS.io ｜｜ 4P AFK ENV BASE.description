hi again everyone :D this video was a bit rushed if you couldn't tell, everyone was nagging for new video so here it is. Special thanks to Thing for helping me build this base and teaching me lots about these types of bases :D deathrain and Apex also give me tips on environmental bases, I watched them build it a lot in the past. This community already has a basic understanding of env bases so I didn't specify everything you would need to do, it's just things to watch out for. 

Edit a few weeks later: servers reset and the spot no longer exists
